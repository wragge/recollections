The letter {{ "James Minahan" | lod_link: "", "people" }} was waiting for had arrived at last. Sent from the firm of {{ "Quong Hing Yeong" | lod_link: "", "organisations" }} in Hong Kong, the letter contained the news that having received a remittance of HK$200 from Australia they could now book him a passage to Melbourne, the city of his birth. At 31 years old, James had decided to return to Australia after twenty-six years in China. He had spent the last decade studying for the imperial examinations (kējǔ) but after three unsuccessful attempts to gain a degree he had decided to try his luck in business in Australia instead.

In late 1907, {{ "James" | lod_link: "James Minahan", "people" }} had written to his father’s former business partner, {{ "Chin Shing" | lod_link: "", "people" }}, asking him to send money for the passage. Over the many years since James and his now dead father had returned to China, Chin Shing had regularly sent them money from the business they jointly owned – a small store at Indigo in northeastern Victoria. Chin Shing would typically give the money to friends going down to Melbourne, who would then send it to Hong Kong though one of the Little Bourke Street stores, such as Hang Yick or, in this case, Sun Nam Hie & Co. The receiving firm in Hong Kong would then send the money on to China, initially to James’s father {{ "Cheong Ming" | lod_link: "", "people" }}, or after Cheong Ming’s death in 1896, to James himself.
